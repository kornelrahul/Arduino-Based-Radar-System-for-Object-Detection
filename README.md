# Arduino-Based-Radar-System-for-Object-Detection
This academic project demonstrates the development of an ultrasonic radar system capable of detecting obstacles and measuring distance using Arduino UNO, HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor, and Servo Motor. The system was designed during my 2nd year, 2nd semester as part of my undergraduate coursework in Electrical and Electronic Engineering (EEE).
